Abstract:
The data in this file come from a survey of adult residents in Hawaii. 
The survey was conducted for a random stratified sample of households 
on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, Molokai, and Lanai in 
Hawaii in the year 2014. These data were collected to record baseline 
human dimensions information and socioeconomic characteristics of Hawaii’s 
coral reef adjacent populations such as human use patterns, management 
support/opposition, and knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of coral 
reefs/coral reef management. These baseline data are being used as a 
starting point for socioeconomic monitoring of Hawaii’s coral reefs. 
Data were collected through the telephone random digit dial survey method, 
and the total sample size for this survey was 2,240 with a response rate 
(number of complete interviews divided by the number of eligible reporting 
units in the sample) of 1.5% and a cooperation rate (proportion of all cases 
interviewed divided by all eligible units ever contacted) of 28.6%.
