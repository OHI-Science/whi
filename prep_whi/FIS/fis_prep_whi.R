#FIS prep

###ISSUE###We are missing catch data that is not associated with islands - Must have along given us data from catch blocks around island (including cross seamount)
##ISSUE resolved with updated catch data FEb 2018#

## setup: libraries, file paths ----
library(tidyverse) # install.packages('tidyverse')
dir_layers <- file.path('~/documents/github/mhi/prep/FIS')


#naming convention of the data file: it is "goalcode_layername_assessmentYEAR.csv".
data_file  <- file.path(dir_layers, 'fis_sus_scores_updated.csv')
d <- readr::read_csv('fis_sus_scores_updated.csv')

#catch
data_file  <- file.path(dir_layers, 'fis_catch_dar.csv')
c <- readr::read_csv('fis_catch_dar.csv')
c<-subset(c, mus!="PMUS")
str(c)

#combine pelagic catch summarized by island into one catch estimate for all of Hawaii - pelagics and bottom fish only
library(plyr)#install.packages('plyr')


d_reef<-subset(c, mus=="CHCRT"|mus=="PHCRT")#subset data for reef fish
#d_reef<-ddply(d_reef, .(species,year,rgn_id), summarise, total=sum(catch), licenses=sum(licenses))#summarize the reef fish landings by rgn also

d_deep7<-subset(c, mus=="BMUS")
#d_deep7<-ddply(d_deep7, .(year, species), summarise, total=sum(catch))
## save this local data layer in "layers" folder with the same naming convention as above format
dir_layers <- file.path('~/documents/github/mhi/region2017/layers')
#readr::write_csv(d_pel, file.path(dir_layers, "fis_pelagic_catch_mhi2017.csv"))
readr::write_csv(d_reef, file.path(dir_layers, "fis_reef_catch_mhi2017.csv"))
readr::write_csv(d_deep7, file.path(dir_layers, "fis_deep7_catch_mhi2017.csv"))
#readr::write_csv(d_pel_islands, file.path(dir_layers, "fis_pel_propcatch_mhi2017.csv"))


## You will see a notification in the "Git" window in RStudio once the layer is saved successfully.
#dont forgt to register the layer in layers.csv

#####all catch data in one file
