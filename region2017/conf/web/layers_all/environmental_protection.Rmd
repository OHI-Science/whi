The percent of nearshore areas and priority watersheds protected. The percent of nearshore waters protected was assessed as the ratio of the area of marine managed areas per West Hawaii region, excluding the NOAA Marine Mammal Sanctuary Waters (NOAA Marine Protected Area (MPA) Inventory) spatial data layer available: http://geoportal.hawaii.gov/datasets/noaa-marine-protected-area-mpa-inventory) to the total area of state waters (coastline to 3nm) within each West Hawaii region. The percent of watersheds is the percent of Hawaii Island priority watersheds that have been fenced. Data comes from Emma Yuen DLNR/DOFAW.
