The total revenue per ocean sector for Hawaii County. Data comes from the NOAA ENOW database (https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/enow.html). Dataset covers from 2005-2014 and is at the County scale. Sectors include: Marine Construction, Living Resources, Ship and Boat Building, Tourism and Recreation, and Marine Transportation (Table #).  Data sets were aggregated and summarized by county.

Blank values indicate that no data is available for that sector and year.
