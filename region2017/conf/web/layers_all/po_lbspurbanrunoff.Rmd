A proxy for nutrient and chemical pollution measured as the percent of impervious surfaces per watershed with a maximum stress level set at 10% of watershed area.

The proxy for nutrient and chemical pollution. Data were summarized by watershed (full data in layers_whi/watershed_land_use_whi2018.csv) and are presented as the ratio of impervious surfaces by watershed set to the maximum stressor value of 10% of watershed area. Mean watershed scores are given for West Hawaiâ€™i regions. Watershed data from USGS National Hydrography Dataset Watershed Boundaries (HUC12). Impervious surface data comes from the NOAA C-CAP 2010/2011 hi-resolution GIS layer (https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/lca).
